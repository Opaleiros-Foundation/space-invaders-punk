This documentation covers:

*   **Architecture:** High-level overview of the system design and components.
*   **Engineering Requirements:** The technical specifications and constraints.
*   **Development Resources:** Guides and references for the tools and libraries used.
*   **Game Assets:** Information on sprites, sounds, and other creative assets.

Let's get started!
